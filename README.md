# Simple Shell Test Suite

> Please **DO NOT edit** any files on github (except AUTHORS) or your local repository to avoid conflicts.  
> To modify the list of test cases run the script and follow the instructions, the list is automatically synchronized.  
> **You should not do any manual push** to avoid uploading run files or test results.  

## How to use the tool

The test suite is based on a shell script that manages the test cases for all versions of the simple shell.  

### Prepare the environment

The first thing to do is clone the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/coding-max/shell_test_suite.git`.  
Once cloned, the simple shell executable must be added to it (the `hsh` file generated by `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic * .c -o hsh`).  

### Run the tool

To run the test suite, use the command: (`./test_suite`). Once inside, you need to enter your holberton ID (to recognize who modifies the list at the time of pushing changes).  
For each step the tool has a guided menu.  

The tool allows:  

- Run test cases for a specific version of simple shell.
- List the current test cases for a specific version (at the end it allows to select a case to delete if necessary).  
- Add new test cases for a specific version.

### Sync

The shell script synchronizes the list of cases (with the github version) every time a new test is to be run or the list is edited.  
Every time you modify a list of cases, the new resulting list is updated on github so it is important to be connected to the internet.  

## Additional information

After adding test cases, you must add yourself as a contributor. For this you must edit the AUTHORS file (do it from github, not in the local repository to avoid conflicts).  
The correct way to add your information to the file is as follows: `Name <email>`.
